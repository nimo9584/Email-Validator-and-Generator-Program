This program has been coded in python. The main agenda behind this is to create a safe as well as efficient environment to validate email addresses belonging to any domains and, generate usernames for new email addresses. One of the primary components of this program is an valid api key from any of the known online email validators like abstract, isitarealemail, etc. The api key will act as the link between the programmer and the email validation server. Once, the email address is typed in, the program will make an entry into the server and search for the address. Based on the result of the search, a json file will be made which will simply imply whether the search was successful or not .i.e. the email is valid or un-valid.
The second part of the program is pretty simple and works with a special library called faker. It is the fake data generation library of python. It can be used for generating tons of data in form of names, addresses, profiles, emails for analytics purposes.
